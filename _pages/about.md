# About Me  
I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence (GSCE), South Dakota State University. My work centers on harnessing mid‑to‑high resolution remote sensing data and deep learning techniques for quantitative parameter retrieval, land‑cover classification, and time‑series reconstruction.

**Research Interests:**  
- Harmonized Landsat & Sentinel‑2 time‑series reconstruction (HLS‑GPT)  
- Intelligent super‑resolution for fine water‑body extraction (ConvFormerSR)  
- Unsupervised deep learning for cloud & water detection  
- Multi‑source data fusion (optical & SAR) for downstream applications
